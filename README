In an era dominated by digital communication and multimedia content, the ability to extract sentiment and emotion from spoken language is increasingly valuable. This project presents a Python-based system for sentiment analysis on audio input, leveraging the capabilities of SpeechRecognition, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), and the NRC (National Research Council) Emotion Lexicon. The system allows users to input audio either through a microphone or by providing an audio file, with sentiment analysis results displayed in a user-friendly interface.

The core implementation involves using the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio and convert it to text using Google's speech recognition API. Subsequently, sentiment analysis is performed using NLTK's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` to compute sentiment scores and the NRC Emotion Lexicon accessed through the `nrclex` library for emotion scores. The system categorizes sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, providing users with insights into the emotional tone of the audio input.

Key features of the system include real-time sentiment analysis from microphone input, batch sentiment analysis of audio files, and a menu-driven interface for ease of use. The project demonstrates the integration of multiple Python libraries for effective sentiment analysis, highlighting its potential applications in areas such as customer feedback analysis, sentiment monitoring in audio content, and sentiment-driven decision-making.

Overall, this project contributes to the field of natural language processing by extending sentiment analysis capabilities to audio input, offering a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding the emotional context of spoken language in various domains.
